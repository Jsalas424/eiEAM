\title{Calculate Pooled Standard Deviation}
\usage{
pooled_sd(var, n, k = length(var))
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{Numeric vector of variances for each group}

\item{n}{Numeric vector of sample sizes for each group}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of groups (defaults to length of var)}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the pooled standard deviation
}
\description{
Calculates the pooled standard deviation across multiple groups by combining
the within-group variances weighted by their degrees of freedom.
}
\examples{
library(dplyr)
set.seed(42)

# Create sample data: 3 groups, 3 observations each
df <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 3),
  value = c(10.2, 11.1, 9.8,    # Group A
            12.5, 13.0, 12.1,   # Group B  
            8.9, 9.5, 8.7)      # Group C
)

# Calculate pooled standard deviation
result <- df |>
  group_by(group) |>
  summarise(n = n(), variance = var(value), .groups = 'drop') |>
  summarise(pooled_sd = pooled_sd(variance, n))
